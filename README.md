encapsulation in java
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.

Advantage of Encapsulation in Java
By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
Test the class easily.
Using getter and setter we can create fast encapsulated class.
